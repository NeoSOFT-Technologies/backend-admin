### installation
`$npm install --save-dev @types/node`
### Testing
Before you share your improvement with the world, use the types yourself by creating a typename.d.ts file in your project and filling out its exports:
```javascript
declare module "libname" {
  // Types inside here
  export function helloWorldMessage(): string
}
```

### Create a new package
If you are the library author and your package is written in TypeScript, bundle the autogenerated declaration files in your package instead of publishing to Definitely Typed.

If you are adding typings for an npm package, create a directory with the same name. If the package you are adding typings for is not on npm, make sure the name you choose for it does not conflict with the name of a package on npm. (You can use npm info <my-package> to check for the existence of the <my-package> package.)

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'

test('double click', () => {
 const onChange = jest.fn()
 render(<input type="checkbox" onChange={onChange} />)
 const checkbox = screen.getByRole('checkbox')
 userEvent.dblClick(checkbox)
 expect(onChange).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2)
 expect(checkbox).not.toBeChecked()
})
```
