This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i / npm install`

This Command will install the dependences that are required to ru this project<br>

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run lint`

this command will run eslint over the src to find error and look for formatting option.<br>
Learn about [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for more information.<br>

### `npm run lint:fix`

this command will fix all the formatting error and fixable error sorted by the eslint and prettier.<br>
Learn about [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for more information.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `descrption`
Admin templates are a set of web pages, built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript or any javascript libraries used to create the user interface of the backend of a web application. These pre-built pages are integrated with the web application for doing backend tasks like maintaining the website, user and content management, installation and configuration of website software, and tracking data like network traffic and user visits to the website, to improve the performance of the website.
